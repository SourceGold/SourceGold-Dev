# Contribution Guide
You should create your own branches named "name/content". Your personal branch is not protected and you can let anyone to push that branch freely. 

Dev branch is loosely protected with only one reviewer needed. You must specify what is in a pull request since it is not possible to read the raw unity format and see what is changed. You are responsible to give clear description of your pull request. 

Main branch is protected with 3 reviewers needed. We should always be careful when merge from dev to main. We should do so in a meeting.
